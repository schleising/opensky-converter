# Progress Dialog

The progress dialog is used to show the progress of the three stages of the conversion process

- Reading the Current File
- Merging the New File into the Current File
- Writing the Output File

While conversion is in progress selecting Cancel at any time will stop the conversion process and close the Progress Dialog

Once the conversion is complete a success message will be displayed and Cancel button will be replaced with a Close button
